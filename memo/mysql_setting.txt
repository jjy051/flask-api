brew install mysql

# after installation of mysql, try start mysql server. 
# and it comes errors.

brew services start mysql
 -> it failed since mysql.sock was not created.
 -> tried serveral things including reinstallation, but it did not solve

# then, try another command to start mysql server

mysql.server start
 -> at first, it failed since it needed permission to read profile
 -> sudo mysql.server start command finally did work!

mysql_secure_installation
 -> setting initial secure config such as root user password and so on.
